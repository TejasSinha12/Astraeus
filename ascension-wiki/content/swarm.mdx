# REST Interface

Project Ascension includes a production-ready Web API to command and control the cognitive system externally.

## Multi-Agent Topologies

Because the `BaseAgent` instance wraps a stateless `CognitionCore`, you can spin up distinct agents optimized for different tasks (e.g., A "Researcher Agent", an "Execution Agent", and a "Code Writer Agent").

The `multi_agent_coordinator.py` maintains an active registry of these nodes.

### Dispatching Tasks

Submit goals via JSON:
```json
POST /api/v1/mission
{
  "objective": "Build a React component",
  "priority": "HIGH"
}
```

The Coordinator parses the objective, decomposes it using the Master Planner, and delegates sub-graphs to the child Swarm nodes asynchronously. Wait for SSE (Server-Sent Events) to monitor realtime trace reasoning output across the Swarm.
