# Overview

The `reasoning_engine.py` functions as the primary abstraction barrier between **Project Ascension** and the underlying Language Model provider. Rather than streaming text openly, the Core Cognition Engine strictly enforces `pydantic` output schema constraints.

<Alert>
  The Core Cognition Engine is async-first. All tool execution loops must await output to prevent blocking the FastApi multi-agent backend.

## Goal Planner

Unlike basic chained prompting, Ascension builds **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**.

When a complex objective is received, the `GoalPlanner` calculates independent operational strands. If a Goal is `Prepare a detailed competitive analysis of X`, the graph resolves to:
1. Search market data (parallel)
2. Scrape competitor sites (parallel)
3. Synthesize findings (depends on 1 and 2)

## Decision Engine Loop

The immediate execution of an operation is governed by the `DecisionEngine`. After reviewing short term context, the engine is forced to output a `NextAction` with one of three states:
- `USE_TOOL`
- `TASK_COMPLETE`
- `FAIL`

### Meta-Cognition Checks
Each action includes a floating point `confidence_score`. The AGI is penalized during the V2 offline training loop if it reports high confidence but triggers a terminal code execution error, ensuring that over time it "knows what it does not know."
