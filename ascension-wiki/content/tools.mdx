# Extending the AGI

Ascension manages tools using a centralized `ToolRegistry`. 

## Writing a Tool

Every tool must inherit from `BaseTool`. You must strictly define the input `pydantic.BaseModel` for validation.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from tools.base_tool import BaseTool

class ProcessQueryToolInput(BaseModel):
    query: str

class ProcessQueryTool(BaseTool):
    name = "process_query"
    description = "Searches the database."
    args_schema = ProcessQueryToolInput
    
    def run(self, args: ProcessQueryToolInput) -> str:
        # Implementation
        return "Found data."
```

## The Sandbox Executor

When the `DecisionEngine` invokes a tool, it is passed to the `ToolExecutor`. This isolated thread runs `try/catch` and enforces timeout blocks.

If a tool crashes, the AGI does not. The traceback is caught, stringified, and returned directly to the Short Term Memory. The AGI will "see" the error, reflect, and attempt a different syntax on the next loop cycle.
