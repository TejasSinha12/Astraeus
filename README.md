# Ascension Intelligence Platform — v5.2.0
![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v5.2.0-blue)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-ready-2496ED?logo=docker&logoColor=white)

Ascension (codenamed **Astraeus**) is an institutional-grade, multi-agent artificial intelligence infrastructure. It replaces traditional, brittle LLM API calls with a resilient, federated *Swarm Execution API* designed for complete codebase autonomy.

---

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

Ascension consists of two components: a Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend.

### Deploy Frontend (Vercel)
Deploy the Next.js workspace interface directly to Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTejasSinha12%2FAstraeus%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fascension-wiki&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_API_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,CLERK_SECRET_KEY)

### Deploy Backend (Docker)
The Ascension orchestration engine is packaged as a Docker container. You can run the entire backend stack (API + Database) using Docker Compose:

1. Clone the repository and configure `.env`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TejasSinha12/Astraeus.git
cd Astraeus
cp .env.example .env # Configure your API keys
```

2. Boot the cluster:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with automated healthchecks monitoring the swarm engine.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Global Coordinator:** A rigid priority queue managing task delegation across dynamic agent profiles (Auditor, Optimizer, Critic).
- **The Forge:** An evolutionary computing module allowing researchers to spawn parallel coding attempts (e.g. comparing SSE vs WebSockets vs Long-polling) and evaluate the best approach.
- **Chronos Engine:** A high-fidelity code replay timeline that lets you scrub through the AGI's neural trace, review decision markers, and reverse engineering reasoning flaws frame-by-frame.

## ✨ Key Features

### Multi-Agent Swarm Execution
- **6 Specialized Agent Roles**: Planner, Architect, Implementer, Critic, Optimizer, Auditor
- **Consensus-Based Merging**: Conflict resolution with agreement scoring
- **Multi-File Codebase Generation**: Full project scaffolding with ZIP export
- **SSE Streaming**: Real-time execution trace delivered to the frontend

### 🔥 The Forge (Evolutionary Multi-Branching)
- **Parallel Swarm Sessions**: Spawns 3 concurrent swarms with different architectural biases (Performance, Scalability, Elegance)
- **Performance Duel**: Side-by-side benchmarking with latency, complexity, and security metrics
- **Optimized Selection**: Automated "fittest branch" recommendation based on your stack
- **Branch Persistence**: All branches are stored in `MissionBranch` for later comparison

### 🕰️ The Chronos Engine (Neural Code Replay)
- **Time-Indexed Reasoning**: Every thought and code snapshot is persisted to `MissionTraceStep`
- **Scrub-able Timeline**: Navigate frame-by-frame through the AGI's reasoning process
- **Neural Replay**: Visualize exact line-by-line code generation as reasoning nodes fire
- **Reasoning Undo/Redo**: Revert not just code, but the thought process behind it

### Federated Swarm Infrastructure
- **Distributed Clusters**: Regional swarm instances with expertise-based routing
- **Global Coordinator**: Intelligent mission dispatch across the federation
- **Federation Protocol**: Signed telemetry exchange between clusters
- **Automatic Rollback**: Federation-wide instability detection and recovery

### Intelligence Economy
- **Dual-Token System**: Consumable credits + non-transferable reputation

- **Adaptive Pricing**: Dynamic cost scaling based on cluster load and complexity
- **Stripe Integration**: Real-time credit top-ups via webhook bridge

### Institutional Multi-Tenancy

- **Institutional Billing Console**: Admin UI for managing team credits
- **Org-Level RBAC**: Middleware-enforced solvency and permission checks
- **Scoped API Keys**: Granular access control with monthly quotas

## 🧬 Intelligence Evolution & Research

Astraeus is a **longitudinal crucible** for multi-agent evolution, powered by the `metrics/reliability_tracker.py` and `metrics/intelligence_index.py` engines. Every mission is a data point for the swarm's collective intelligence drift analysis.

### 🔬 Research Framework
- **Mission Lineage (DAG)**: Every artifact is part of a non-linear evolution tree. Researchers can fork specific mission IDs to test alternate cognitive trajectories.
- **Hypothesis-Driven Consensus**: Agents (Planner/Architect) declare a success hypothesis which is cross-audited by the *Critic* and *Auditor* using quantitative reliability scoring.
- **Uncertainty Quantization**: The `IntelligenceIndex` calculates an agreement-to-complexity ratio, helping researchers identify "Hallucination Risk Zones" in complex architectures.
- **Evolutionary Persistence**: Successful logic patterns are "weighted" in the swarm's memory, ensuring that optimal architectural decisions are reused in subsequent generations.

### 📈 Benchmarking & Reliability
- **Agent Leaderboards**: Real-time performance tracking via `ReliabilityTracker`, monitoring success rates, regression counts, and average confidence levels per agent role.
- **Neural Cost Efficiency**: The platform tracks the **Intelligence-to-Token (I/T) Ratio**, optimizing for the minimum token expenditure required to achieve architectural convergence.
- **Longitudinal Reliability**: Automatic tracking of regression frequencies across evolution cycles, with a platform threshold of **98.2% zero-regression compliance**.
- **Accuracy Calibration**: The `telemetry.py` engine monitors real-time "Latency-to-Confidence" curves, ensuring the swarm never compromises on reasoning depth for execution speed.

## 🔒 Security & Governance

- **Clerk JWT Authentication**: Institutional-grade session management with role-based access gates.
- **Dual-Scheme RBAC**: Full interoperability between web-based researcher sessions and programmatic Developer API Keys.
- **HMAC-SHA256 Signed Ledger**: Every token debit and code generation event is cryptographically signed and stored in a tamper-evident audit trail.
- **Hardened Execution Sandbox**: Critical mission logic runs in isolated containers with restricted egress and CPU/Memory quotas.
- **Audit Compliance Explorer**: Streamed audit logs with structured metadata for institutional compliance and revenue overhead analysis.
- **Platform Health Telemetry**: Multi-tier heartbeat monitoring of the FastAPI Gateway, Swarm Orchestrator, and PostgreSQL state.
