# Project Ascension 🚀 (v5.0.0)

> **Institutional-Grade AI Infrastructure**: A unified, monetizable ecosystem for autonomous research, multi-tenant intelligence orchestration, and cryptographically verifiable scientific discovery.

Ascension is no longer just a swarm; it is a **Global Intelligence Marketplace**. It bridges the gap between raw LLM reasoning and professional research by providing a production-hardened platform for institutions, enterprises, and individual developers.

---

## 🏛️ Institutional Intelligence Layer

Ascension provides a multi-tenant framework designed for high-stakes research environments:

- **Organizational Orchestration**: Isolated research containers for universities and labs with custom governance and RBAC.
- **Grant Automation Engine**: Automatically generates peer-review grade research proposals aligned with global funding themes (NSF, DARPA).
- **Decentralized Validation Network**: A consensus-based network of external nodes that verifies swarm findings and manages reputation through staking.
- **Tournament Orchestrator**: Facilitates live benchmark challenges and competitive swarm evolution cycles with transparent scoring.

---

## 💎 Revenue-Grade Infrastructure

Designed for commercial execution and investor-grade operational maturity:

- **Production REST API**: Secure, high-performance endpoints with hashed API key management and scoped permissions.
- **Stripe-Integrated Billing**: Real-time credit top-ups and token-based metering for sustainable AGI execution.
- **Signed Billing Ledger**: A PostgreSQL-backed financial record of every model call, recorded with `HMAC-SHA256` integrity.
- **OpenTelemetry Observability**: Distributed tracing and request auditing for absolute transparency and stability.

## 🐝 Autonomous Code Swarm

Project Ascension's cognitive core continues to leverage its specialized workforce:

- **Planner**: Deconstructs objectives into measurable mission DAGs.
- **Architect**: Designs structural solutions with AST/Code Graph awareness.
- **Implementer**: Generates high-efficiency, sandboxed code.
- **Auditor**: Validates security constraints and performance deltas.

---

## 🔬 Scientific Verification Tier

Every architectural change is treated as a verifiable experiment:

- **A/B Evolution**: Parallel runs against a static control branch to validate intelligence gains.
- **Fitness Diff Analysis**: Computes structural entropy reduction and token efficiency gains per cycle.
- **Hypothesis Tagging**: Agents declare measurable targets before modification, ensuring falsifiability.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API Key
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Redis (for Rate Limiting)
- Stripe Account (for Billing Integration)

### Deployment
1. **Frontend**: Deploy the [Next.js Wiki](https://astraeus-livid.vercel.app) to Vercel.
2. **Backend**: Deploy the [FastAPI Gateway](https://astraeus-r4pf.onrender.com) to Render or Railway.
3. **Database**: Provision a PostgreSQL instance (Neon.tech recommended).

## 🌐 Public Endpoints
- **Missions**: `/api/missions`
- **Institutional Control**: `/api/institutional`
- **Production Reasoning**: `/v1/execute/swarm/reasoning`
- **Developer Billing**: `/api/billing`

---

## 🧬 Ethics & Security
- **Hardened Sandbox**: Code execution is isolated with strict resource caps.
- **Transparent Auditing**: Every cognitive step is logged and traceable via OpenTelemetry spans.
- **Reputation Governance**: System evolution is gated by non-transferable reputation tokens earned through valid research contributions.
